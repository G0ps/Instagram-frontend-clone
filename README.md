# Instagram Clone (Practice Project)

This is a **beginner-friendly practice project** where I built a simple Instagram frontend clone by following a tutorial from YouTube.  
The project uses **React (frontend)** and **JSON Server (backend)** to simulate a basic Instagram-like experience.

---

## 🚀 Features
- React-based frontend (with Vite)
- JSON Server as a mock backend
- Beginner-friendly setup

---

## 📂 Project Structure
 ```bash
instagramclonereact/
├── db/                # contains db.json for JSON Server
├── src/               # React source code
├── package.json       # contains scripts to run server & client
```

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
2. ```
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   cd instagramclonereact
   ```


3. **Install dependencies (server + client)**

   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

4. **Start both backend (JSON Server) and frontend (React)**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Alternative: full setup in one command**

   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

## 📌 Available Scripts

* `npm run server` → starts JSON Server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* `npm run client` → starts React frontend on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
* `npm start` → runs both server + client in parallel
* `npm run install:all` → installs all required dependencies
* `npm run setup` → installs everything and starts the project
